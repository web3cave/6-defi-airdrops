February 14th.
You can continue to earn $BLUR care packages by posting bids on collections until then.

Blur:â€‚$BLUR is launching February 14
We know this is past our initial estimate of January and weâ€™re sorry for the delay. Weâ€™re trying new things and the extra two weeks will allow us to deliver a launch that hasnâ€™t been done before. Airdrop 3 will continue until then.]]></summary>
