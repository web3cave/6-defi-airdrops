Here it is recommended to provide liquidity in a pool on any of the supported chains.
Some people think holding a small amount of its native $STG token and locking it -> $veSTG could help. https://t.co/ABGk0PJs4K]]></summary>

Last week news of a $120m funding round at $3b valuation by LayerZero made the round.
That valuation is quite impressive and could result in a juicy $ZRO airdrop in the event of a token launch.
