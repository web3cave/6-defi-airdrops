February 14th.
You can continue to earn $BLUR care packages by posting bids on collections until then.

Blur: $BLUR is launching February 14
We know this is past our initial estimate of January and we’re sorry for the delay. We’re trying new things and the extra two weeks will allow us to deliver a launch that hasn’t been done before. Airdrop 3 will continue until then.]]></summary>
